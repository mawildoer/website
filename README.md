# Personal Website

I have opened the source to my personal website so that anyone may copy it. 

## Resources

 - [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) framework to compile the site (Apache 2.0)
 - [Anatole](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole) theme (MIT)
 - [NearlyFreeSpeech](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/) for hosting, DNS and domain
 
## How to 
Mainly as a reminder to myself when I come back to edit:

 - Clone this repo w/ `--recurse-submodules`
 - Download hugo - tested w/ 0.81.0
 - Put `hugo.exe` in the root of this repo (don't worry, it's in the `.gitignore`)
 - Spin up `cmd.exe` and `cd` to the repo's root
 - Run `hugo serve`
 - Develop and tweak to your hearts content
 - Get the site's SSH/SFTP information from NearlyFreeSpeech->[member login]->Sites->mawildoer
 - SFTP the content of the `public` directory generated by HUGO to the server
