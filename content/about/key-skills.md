**What I do best**


### Rapid Prototyping
From software, electronics, mechanical, CNC machining to debugging circuit boards, I have the expertise and expereience to get a representative prototype running quickly and cost-effectively delviering the imperative real-world data needed to move forward with confidence. 

### Value Focus
Context is everything. I ensure I understand the background so I can focus on what matters to the project and deliver. 

### Problem Solving
I break problems down to their core to devise 

### Software Development
From chasing micro-seconds in an embedded real-time system, constructing AI-enabled robots to building this website, software is what I do best.

### Iteration
Revolution doesn't happen without a few mistakes. I develop to minimise the cost of missteps and try, try again.

### Communication
I put in the effort to ensure that I we are on the same page. I am not shy of a crowd and excel in presentation.
